                        <h2>My Learning Narrative:</h2>
                        <h4> I am a motivated individual with hands-on experience in both the radio and television
                            industries, as well as in health administration. Currently, I'm a student eager to turn my
                            life around by diving into the world of programming; an avenue I wish I had explored back in
                            2010.

                            Over the years, I've gained a clearer understanding of how I learn best: <br></br> in structured
                            settings, through practical experience, and by revisiting foundational concepts. I place
                            great importance on clear documentation, writing maintainable code, and adhering to the
                            principle of continuous improvement, rather than rushing to master advanced tools and concepts.<br></br> I believe
                            that mistakes are valuable learning opportunities rather than setbacks to be dreaded.
